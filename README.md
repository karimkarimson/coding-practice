# Hi :wave: intrigued Human!

This is my Coding-Practice Playground.

- I started with the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges and was able to learn a lot. I m far from finished but really enjoy the voyage!
- Also [L33tcode](https://leetcode.com/) has taught me a lot and because of the smaller chapters, it has become my daily go to.
